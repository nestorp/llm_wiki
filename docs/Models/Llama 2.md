Second version of the [[Llama]] model by [[Meta AI]]. Three variations of the model with different sizes have been released: 7B, 13B and 70B. For comparison, the largest Llama model was 65B. In most benchmarks, Llama 2 outperforms other open source LLMs such as Falcon. No comparison to closed models such as OpenAI have been made yet. The company has published a [paper](https://scontent-lhr8-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/10000000_663429262362723_1696968207443577320_n.pdf?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=3c67a6&_nc_ohc=5ol-jUSglG4AX_z1Kjr&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-2.xx&oh=00_AfAVDBJG5pCYd7itv9xYwq37oSonlORdgAw-pLUr-gfihg&oe=64BBB691) for this model.

Llama 2 is released under what they call the [Llama 2 community licence](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/blob/main/LICENSE). This is a commercial licence with some limitations. Of note: the outputs of the Llama 2 model cannot be used to train other models, and commercial use is restricted to companies with under 700 million monthly active users.

With the release of this model, it also becomes apparent that Meta AI is aware of the open source community that has sprung out around its Llama models and the company is trying to turn it into a commercial/research advantage. This is reflected in the fact that along with the model release, Meta AI has also announced the following:

- A [responsible use guide](https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/361643215_1004219997281331_6332933766797859993_n.pdf?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=ae5e01&_nc_ohc=4bD2ixIWrlEAX9z_dvZ&_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.xx&oh=00_AfBBl2AGeJzsQOpLEjO849AHIZ1P1MY68TTXBwcMwrybtQ&oe=64BB0C07).
- The launch of a [research community](https://ai.meta.com/llama/open-innovation-ai-research-community/) initiative, open to professors of accredited universities.
